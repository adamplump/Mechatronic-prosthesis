The fingers are bent during the movement of actuators mounted in the hand, connected to the electronic system via the A4988 controller. The fingers return to the spread position thanks to torsion springs, which preserve mechanical energy. The rotation of the metacarpus backwards and forwards is possible thanks to a stepper motor attached to a specially designed shaft, while rotation in the axis of rotation is possible thanks to a servo mounted in the arm.

Safety system based on the use of:
a) Torsion springs - to prevent fingers from bending in the opposite direction.
b) Cable tension - also eliminates uncontrolled bending of the fingers.
c) TPE material for finger pads - a material resistant to fuels, lubricants, hydrolysis, UV rays and other atmospheric factors. Additionally, the material has anti-slip properties.
d) Measurement of the force exerted on the object during gripping - measured by the RA9P pressure sensor and displayed on the LCD screen
e) Motor restrictions - the ability to program the motors to deflect only by a certain angle.
